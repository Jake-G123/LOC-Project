Some things that I believe need to be fixed/added :
        - Input validation currently does not work. The assignment seems to imply that Academic Program is the only one that cant be blank?
        - Editing adds new row instead of changing pre existing --FIXED BUT FORM DOES NOT USE UPDATED OBJECT--
        - On LOC Sprint #1 Tina left this comment:
                Great start!

                Error messages are persisting when I switch between divisions. 

                Hide the editable form until a division is selected, and again after Save or Cancel.

                One HTML validation error.
        - Might need to have multiple academic programs per division. This would be a nightmare to implement


Things that need to be changed 12/1/2025: Take aways on project and current build
        - Swap the organization from the divisions to the program in the app.js on load so if deadline is set it will order correctly
        - Have a add/delete is almost implemented but broke the logic earlier and deleted most of that code. Will set up at a later time if needed
                * Seems un-needed at this time.
        - Styling should have the header bar work but with the animation given for the flip it will get covered by and need to find a fix to that
                * There is no sticky on header currently
                * Re organization of the styling would help too 
        - The validation for the home page isn't working/implemented
                * Unsure if its needed since the actual division name for division page
        - Need to change naming of some properties for user interface. 
                * Home and form don't make much sense
        - Another tab to have a check list checker board style on if the program is going to be reviewed. 
                * Can connect to the header year to find it
                * Un-needed at this point in time
        - Remove the check deadline on the divisions itself its not needed.
                * Take logic from home page organization and swap it with the form page for object name
