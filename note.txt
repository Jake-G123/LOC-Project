Some things that I believe need to be fixed/added :
        - Input validation currently does not work. The assignment seems to imply that Academic Program is the only one that cant be blank?
        - Editing adds new row instead of changing pre existing
        - On LOC Sprint #1 Tina left this comment:
                Great start!

                Error messages are persisting when I switch between divisions. 

                Hide the editable form until a division is selected, and again after Save or Cancel.

                One HTML validation error.
        - Might need to have multiple academic programs per division. This would be a nightmare to implement
